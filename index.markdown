# Welcome to WRC East Bay! üíóüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüéâ

In the Fall of 2022 a few women runners in Oakland started talking about how we could come together to create a women‚Äôs run group in the East Bay. Women‚Äôs Run Club/Collective East Bay is evolving out of that! We don‚Äôt actually have an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù name yet so let us know if you have suggestions :) This club is still in the forming stage and will be what we build together! This is a living website to share some thinking about who we are and what we could be with our community.

# Mission & Values
Our mission is to foster a fun, accessible, come-as-you-are community for women and non-binary runners rooted in the East Bay. We want our club to uplift values of inclusion, local community engagement, & celebrating each other as athletes and people.

# Why Now
In 2022 we have a lot of inspiration to look to in terms of run clubs in the East Bay. From LMJS which has been serving our community since 1977 (!) to Oakland Track Club to Renegade Running to Salmon Run Club to East Bay Beer Runners to Trail Sisters East Bay, there is no shortage of clubs to look to for examples of awesomeness! Arete Oakland is also an important forerunner that for the last six years has provided one of the only women-focused running communities in the East Bay. Arete continues to be a wonderful option particularly for folks who are excited about the multi-chapter/nationwide aspect of Arete or who are interested in receiving access to training plans, runcation meetups, and product discounts (or if you just love Arete and want the stability of a more established club!). We are inspired by the women-centered community we see in Arete and by the local roots, lower cost and inclusive spirit (and not-for-profit model) we see in clubs like Oakland Track Club. That brings us to this moment now - talking about forming a club!

# What
A lot of what our club becomes will be what we build together, so some (many?!) things aren‚Äôt planned yet. For now we have a Slack space and we‚Äôll aim to kick off some more formal programming in the new year. 

# 2023 could look like:
Free to join (we don‚Äôt have any costs yet). If you are in Slack, you are a member.
Regularly scheduled weekday runs in Oakland (and hopefully some joint runs with other local groups!)
Regularly scheduled weekend runs around the East Bay
Active Slack forum for planning ad hoc meet-ups, discussing training, postpartum/injury recovery journeys, volunteering/community engagement opportunities, gear swap & more!
Norming, forming, & storming as a club and maybe we can get some swag?!

In the future we could incorporate as a non-profit if we think the structure will help us or charge a small membership fee if we have costs. 

# FAQ
I have a friend who wants to join. How can I get them added to Slack? 
Send them this form: [https://tinyurl.com/wrc-jointheteam](https://tinyurl.com/wrc-jointheteam). Our onboarding committee will commit to adding in new folks on a monthly basis, but if you have a friend you know is waiting feel free to give Ali Glenesk or Nicole Churchill-Yip a nudge. 

## Who is leading WRC? Who will be a member of WRC in 2023?
We don‚Äôt have a formal leadership structure yet - maybe we should have elections? That said, in case the context is helpful Aisling Grogan, Becca Roelofs and Nicole Churchill-Yip were early ideators for the group. In terms of membership for 2023: if you are in our Slack group, then you are a member. What membership will mean and what our community will look like is something that we will have to build together!

## Will this be competing with other East Bay run clubs? 
There is not (that we know of!) an active women‚Äôs run club in the East Bay that has local roots, spans many running disciplines, and is free or low cost to join. In that sense, we hope this will be something new that will serve runners who we may not have met yet - runners craving similar paced teammates or looking for a women-centered space without a high annual price tag. For runners already plugged into an existing club, we hope that our group can be a value-add to the broader running community ecosystem - we are a ‚ÄúYes and‚Äù if you will. Hopefully we can also have some joint runs with other East Bay running groups.

## Is this a road specific run group? 
We plan on scheduling road, track, and trail group runs. And there may be some members training for triathlons!

## How can I help? 
Inviting a friend to WRC, organizing ad-hoc runs in #run-meets while we get off the ground, and starting conversations in other WRC Slack channels is a great start. Beyond that, areas that will likely need help:
- Creating a social media presence or maybe a website or listserv
- Onboarding new members (e.g. adding to Slack and making sure new folks have friendly faces to welcome them at their first run)
- Planning monthly programming in 2023
- Organizing Slack channels, adding more fun emojis, starting conversation, and norming
- Outreach
- Writing community guidelines / code of conduct for slack
- Leadership / Strategy 
If you are interested in any of these please email or Slack DM Nicole or post in our general channel on WRC Slack. 

## I have feedback and questions. Who do I ask? 
Please share feedback, ideas, and questions in whatever medium is most comfortable to you. As a starting point, feel free to post in the general channel on WRC Slack or DM Nicole if you prefer a more private conversation.


# Thank you and let‚Äôs do this!ü¶Ñ

PS If you‚Äôve made it this far and you‚Äôre stoked for WRC (or whatever our name will be ü§™), go post some hype on Slack for the community vibes!
