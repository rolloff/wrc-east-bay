## Running locally
Jekyll is a static site generator. Get set up locally by following quickstart guide on [their website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). Note that for Mac OS you may wish to install a newer version of Ruby than what comes out of the box in order to get things working [reference here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

Once you have prereqs set up, run `jekyll serve`from repo root - then you'll be able to see the site running locally.
