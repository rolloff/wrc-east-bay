# Weekly Runs

While our Instagram and Slack are the best places to find the most up to date scheduling info, below is a typical week. We've included typical paces so you know what to expect. We do our best to welcome newcomers at each and every run, and to support teammates at many places in their running journey. If we don't have a run that fits your pace or schedule yet, hopefully we will in the future - hey maybe you can lead it!
